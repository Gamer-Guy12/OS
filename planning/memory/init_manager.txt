- first go through the multiboot structures and convert them into physical memory regions
- then reserve space for the kernel
    - create a kernel and next region
    - kernel holds the kernel
    - next holds the space after the kernel that would have been held in the previous one
    - set up next and the kernel
    - copy them to kernel gp memory
    - set up next and previous
    - destroy all empty regions and then create new nexts and previouses
- reserve the first megabyte of space since u shouldn't write in that either if it hasn't been reserved already
- allocate a page to hold the info for the physical memory manager
    - If it is bigger than a page go into kernel panic with code 1
    - make sure that when u make page tables, the first page of the physical info is still mapped to where it is so nothing breaks
- create a new set of page tables that unmaps the lower pages
