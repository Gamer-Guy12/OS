Virtual memory management:
im fucking tired so imma play minecraft
idgaf that im behind

vmm_region_t is a region such as for user and kernel space
vmm_region_t:
    - start addr
    - end addr
    - code start and end (exec no write)
    - data start and end (write no exec)
    - read only start and end (no exec no write)
    - autogen code start and end (exec and write (will not be loaded and will be zeroed out to start))
    - program break start and end (heap)
    - stack top and bottom (stack bottom is the start and stack top grows down)
    - spinlock_t for each section
    - flags
        - userspace
Autogen is prolly really unsafe but idgaf

We need a bst!
