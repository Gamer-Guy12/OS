Memory Management:

Three managers
- Page Manager
    - Frees and allocates physical pages
- Virtual Manager
    - Maps and Unmaps pages into Memory
- Malloc or something similar
    - Gets pages from memory and uses them to give small chunks to programs

Keeping track of physical pages:
- The allocator has a list of memory regions
    - When it becomes empty it is released
    - When all others are full it will find a new one

Temporary 16 kilobyte heap will be used
