Heap Allocation:

Stack Based:
Make minimum allocation size 8 bytes
Add an extra 8 bytes before each allocation
It contains the size in multiples of 8 bytes
The bottom three bits are unused and so are used for metadata
bit 0: not Top of Heap
This one says whether this is the top of the heap, the previous allocation has this bit set when an allocation is made
bit 1: Free
Says whether thingy is Free
if it is also the top of the heap, it will be freed and everything below it will recusrivly be freed

The address is passed in and then 8 bytes is subtracted to find the metadata

Advantages
    - Simple
Disadvantages:
    - Wastes memory if it wasn't used recently
        - May not matter because heap should probably contain memory that works like a stack but bigger
    - Inconsistent speeds
        - Sometimes allocation takes longer than other times
