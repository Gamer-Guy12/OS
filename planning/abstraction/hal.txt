The HAL has architecture specific parts and general purpose parts:

architecture specific:
- PCIe
- clock
- Some graphics as in the VGA driver
- Memory
- Threading

general purpose:
- Graphics

Other things are abstracted though not part of the hal:
- ACPI (Exposes the SDT tables but not the XSDP/RSDP or XSDT/RSDT)
    - MADT

acpi interface:
- inititialize acpi
- get MADT

hal interface:
- init hal
    - calls init on other subsystems of the hal
    - all subsystems return a struct containg global things
- get Memory
    - mmap
    - munmap
