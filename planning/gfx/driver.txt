Every driver returns a graphics config struct which contains info

struct Graphics config
- Flags (uint16_t)
    - offset 0: available (1 true, 0 false)
    - offset 1: text (1 text, 0 no text)
    - offset 2: graphics (1 graphics, 0 no graphics)
- Width (uint16_t)
    - For graphics its based on pixels
    - For text its based on amount of chars
- Height (uint16_t)
    - Same as width
- Reserved (uint16_t)
- Configure Text (void (*configText)(uint8_t, uint8_t)) (64 bit)
    - first param: Foreground Color
    - second param: Background Color
    - There will be an enum for text colors
- Put Char At (void (*putcharat)(uint16_t, uint16_t, char)) (64 bit)
    - First Param: x pos
    - second Param: y pos
    - third param: char to put
